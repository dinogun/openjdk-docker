# How it works

```
# Run ./generate_latest_sums.sh to get the shasums for the latest binaries available on adoptopenjdk.net
./generate_latest_sums.sh

# You should now have two files hotspot-shasums-latest.sh and openj9-shasums-latest.sh
# These will have the shasums for the latest version for each of the supported arches for hostpot and openj9

# You can now run update-multiarch.sh to generate the Dockerfiles for all supported arches for both hotspot and OpenJ9
./update-multiarch.sh
